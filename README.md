## Overview of Project
Create a webpage that includes a dynamic table to allow users to filter for criteria for UFO sightings using date, city, state, country, and shape.

# Results
Any search criteria can be entered to filter the results. One or multiple fields can be populated to narrow search results.

Filter results based on a date:

Filter results based on a date, and on the state:

# Summary
One drawback to this design is that in order to clear the fields, you need to manually delete them to refresh the filtered table. Two recommendations for further development would be to insert a 'Clear' button and to create drop down menus for each field to include all items in the data. This will prevent a user from searching a city without a sighting, and or possible typos making results null.
